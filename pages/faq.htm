						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
							<p><span class="style_bold">Q: Can anyone join Parent Congress?</span><br />
								A: Parent Congress is a District Wide Parent Organization designed to support the Toledo Public Schools.
								Members are appointed by the Parent Organizations within each school and approved by the Principal of
								the school. Download the <a href="../documents/ParentRepForm12-13.pdf">Representative Form</a> here to start the process of becoming a member.

							<p><span class="style_bold">Q: What can Parent Congress do for me?</span><br />
								A: Parent Congress is a networking tool for the Parent Organizations within Toledo Public Schools to get
								ideas from each other while building a community within our District. It gives the Parents a direct line
								to the Adminstration of TPS in order to stay up to date on the things going on within our School District.
								Parent Congress has a Representative that sits on the horseshoe at the Board of Education Meetings allowing
								information and questions to get to the "right" people in a timely manner. Parent Congress is also currently 
								completing the task of implementing an Umbrella 501(c)(3) to cover Parent Organizations within the District 
								which will assist them in raising funds to do what they do best (support 
								our schools).<br /><a href="../documents/BROCHURE.pdf">Download our new brochure</a>.
